This is the website where you can download every song/album, I made. You can also comment on songs and albums.

I use this project to get more familiar with [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org), [Java](http://java.com), [Log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) and [JUnit](http://junit.org/).

This page is in beta stage right now, so expect bugs and/or failures.

If you want to help, you're free to do so.
